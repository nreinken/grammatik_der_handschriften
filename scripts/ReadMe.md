- ***complexGraphemes.R*** --- tests if the letters in complex graphemes are more often joined and if they have different shapes   
- ***distinctivity.R*** --- tests if similar letter shapes occur in the same positions within a syllable  
- ***doubleConsonants.R*** --- tests if the parts of double consonants have the same shape or a different one  
- ***eShapeFunction.R*** --- tests if the e shapes correlate with certain e functions  
- ***graphematicFeet.R*** --- tests if graphematic feet are visible by looking at letter junctions as well as letter forms   
- ***hShapeFunction.R*** --- tests if the shape and the function of a h do correlate
- ***hShapeJunction.R*** --- tests if the shape of h and the existence of a junction with the next/previous letter are dependent
- ***lettershapeDiphthongs.R*** --- tests if the letters have a different shape if they occur as second part of a diphthong 
- ***lettershapeKey.R*** --- tests for each letter if it has a different shape in the key syllable position   
- ***lettershapeMorpho.R*** --- tests if the letter shape is different if the letter shows morphological processes 
- ***lettershapeSyllablePosition.R*** --- tests if the letter shape is different at various syllable positions   
- ***lettershapePhon.R*** --- tests wether the letter shapes correlate with the phoneme class of the corresponding phoneme   
- ***lettershapeTension.R*** --- tests if stressed and unstressed vowels have different letter shapes
- ***lettershapeVoicedness.R*** --- tests if the letter shape is different with voiced and unvoiced consonant
- ***lShapeSyllableBoundaries.R*** --- tests if the l shape is dependent on the syllable boundaries   
- ***morphemeBoundaries.R*** --- tests if letters at morpheme boundaries are typically joined or not
- ***reducedEMorpho.R*** --- tests if the reduced e occurs more often in inflexion affixes   
- ***syllableBoundaries.R*** --- tests if letters at syllable boundaries are typically joined or not
- ***rightLeftEdge.R*** --- tests if the right edge of a word has striking letter forms and checks if the first and last letter are more frequently joined to the next or previous letter   
- ***shapesByPersonAndLetter.R*** --- calculates the amount of letter shapes each individual text contains for each letter
