# How can complex graphemes be identified in German?

This subbranch contains source code files for my article "How can complex graphemes be identified in German?", submitted to Linguistic Vanguard.  
In this article I investigated whether and how complex graphemes are marked in handwritings. For this purpose, I compiled a corpus of handwritten texts. These texts come from the GraphVar corpus by Kristian Berg (ed.): https://graphvar.uni-bonn.de/.

Due to legal reasons, please write an email to me for the raw corpus files.
