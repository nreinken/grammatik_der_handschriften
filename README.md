# grammatik_der_handschriften

This repository contains supplementary files for my PhD project "The Grammar of Handwriting".  
In this project I investigated whether and how handwritten signs correlate with linguistic units. For this purpose, I compiled a corpus of handwritten texts. These texts come from the GraphVar corpus by Kristian Berg (ed.): https://graphvar.uni-bonn.de/.


###Repository structure  
/corpus:  the scans of the handwritten Abitur essays, divided by year.  
/scripts: the analysis scripts (R)  
Graphs_MAIN.xlsb: the annotated corpus  
pval.R: a script to perform the Bonferroni-Holm correction
